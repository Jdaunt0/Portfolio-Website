                        During my time at Sample Assist as a Software Engineer I completed 2 different projects:<br/><br/>
                        - In my first project, I worked with a team of five interns in researching a replacement cloud-based database infrastructure for a production medical app. Our team outlined a migration plan for their current cloud infrastructure from Google Firebase to AWS.<br/><br/>
                        - In my second project, I managed a team of four interns in building a production DevOps Dashboard, the project was built on react.js with a responsive front end. The backend was built using Node.js and utilised RESTful APIs.

                        In my current role as a web developer, I have built upon my skills of responsive web design, 
                        time management and interpersonal skills. Being a solo web developer/designer with several 
                        concurrentclients means that I need to manage my time effectively to meet deadlines. The role 
                        also requires me to listen to client’s ideas, understand what is important to their business 
                        needs, collaborate with them to meet their needs and bring their ideas to life in a timely manner.
                        communication and collaboration are essential skills to meeting my client’s needs. <br/><br/>
                        My reputation in the web development field relies on my reputation with clients and the work I
                        produce. I make sure to always build my clients websites with industry standard techniques
                        such as mobile first development, constantly learn new web development techniques and stay
                        updated on new technologies.
